## Extended Acetylation Damage Analysis Protocol (Human Data)

### STEP 1: Preparation and Alignment to Human Genome (GRCh38)

1. Obtain Reference Genome and Index
	- Download the human genome version GRCh38 from a reliable database such as Ensembl.
	- Create an index for this genome suitable for read alignment.

2. Align Reads to Human Genome  
	- Align the quality-controlled sequencing reads to the human reference genome using a sensitive alignment strategy optimized for accuracy.

3. Convert and Sort Alignments
	- Convert alignment results into a suitable format for downstream analyses, then sort and index these results for efficient access.

4. Deduplication of Reads
	- Remove duplicate reads to ensure accurate assessment of genuine genomic signals, and re-index the deduplicated alignment files.

5. Perform Basic Quality Checks  
	- Run standard checks to assess the quality of the alignment and obtain metrics such as overall alignment rate and insert size distributions.

6. Generate Coverage Tracks  
	- Produce genome-wide coverage tracks normalized to allow comparisons across samples, facilitating visualization and comparison of read distributions.

7. Peak Identification  
	- Identify regions of significant enrichment (peaks) of acetylation signals, adjusting parameters to detect broad peak patterns typical of acetylation marks.


### STEP 2: Quality Assurance of Replicates

1. Consistency Checks Across Replicates  
	- Use clustering or principal component analyses (PCA) to ensure samples labeled as controls and damaged treatments cluster according to expectations.
	- Identify potential sample labeling issues or unexpected variability.


### STEP 3: Differential Analysis of Acetylation Signalsz

1. Create a Consensus Peak Set  
	- Generate a combined set of peaks detected across all samples to define a unified set of genomic regions for comparison.

2. Quantify Reads per Region  
	- Count the number of reads aligning to each consensus region across all samples to prepare data for differential analysis.

3. Perform Differential Acetylation Analysis  
	- Analyze the read counts statistically to identify genomic regions showing significant differences in acetylation between damaged and control groups.


### STEP 4: Targeted Examination of Integration Site

1. Investigate Specific Region  
	- Specifically examine the genomic region on chromosome 2L around position 22,245,311, the identified site of interest.
	- Identify differential peaks near or overlapping this locus to determine the impact of damage on acetylation.

2. Visualize Acetylation Patterns  
	- Generate clear visualizations comparing acetylation coverage between control and damaged samples at and near the integration site.

3. Interpret Results  
	- Clearly assess whether there is an increase in acetylation marks at the integration site in the damaged samples and document the extent and boundaries of enrichment.


### STEP 5: Reporting and Documentation

  Summarize all analysis steps clearly, including quality control, alignment statistics, consistency checks, and differential analyses.
  Provide clear visual summaries and documentation.
  Discuss the implications regarding sample integrity, potential mislabeling, and contamination, based on the differential acetylation patterns observed.
