Dros_H3K9ac_bulkChIC_Analysis


## 1. Prepare Resources
- Obtain the Drosophila reference genome (for example, dm6) and the corresponding genome annotation file (GTF or similar).
- Confirm that you have installed Bowtie2, SAMtools, MACS2, and R (plus the necessary R packages, such as DiffBind or csaw).

## 2. Quality Control
1. Gather the raw FASTQ files for all samples.
2. Check the quality of each FASTQ file using a quality control tool (such as FastQC).
3. If required, remove any adapter contamination and filter out low-quality reads with a suitable tool (for instance, Trim Galore! or Trimmomatic).

## 3. Alignment
1. Generate or download the Bowtie2 index for the Drosophila dm6 reference genome.
2. Use Bowtie2 to align the reads from each sampleâ€™s FASTQ file to the reference genome.
3. Convert the alignment output (SAM format) to binary format (BAM), then sort and index the resulting BAM files using SAMtools.

## 4. Peak Calling
1. Run MACS2 (or another preferred peak-calling tool) on each sample using the sorted BAM file.  
2. If you have an appropriate control (either an input sample or an IgG control), specify it during peak calling to improve accuracy.  
3. If a separate control is not available, adjust the peak-calling parameters for cut&run data accordingly.

## 5. Differential Analysis
1. In R, load the relevant packages (such as DiffBind or csaw).  
2. Prepare a sample sheet or equivalent metadata table containing information about each sample (for example, file paths to BAM files, sample names, and experimental conditions).  
3. Read in the sample metadata, count reads within peak regions, and set up contrasts between the damaged and control conditions.  
4. Carry out the differential analysis to identify regions where H3K9 acetylation differs significantly between control and damaged samples.

## 6. Focus on the Integration Site
1. Note the integration site of interest on chromosome 2L, around position 22,245,311 (40F6).  
2. Filter your results to find any peaks overlapping or near this region.  
3. (Optionally) create coverage or enrichment tracks to compare control versus damaged samples around the integration site.  
4. Determine if there is an apparent increase in H3K9 acetylation marks at this location in the damaged samples, and estimate the boundaries of any enriched region.

## 7. Summarise and Report Findings
- Compile the key results, including quality control summaries, peak statistics, and differential binding analysis tables.  
- Prepare any relevant plots or figures to illustrate the acetylation levels at the integration site.  
- Document the differences in H3K9 acetylation between control and damaged groups, highlighting any increased marking at the target locus.
