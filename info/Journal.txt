Prior:
- Collected sample folders containing raw FASTQ files for analysis.
- Assessed sequence quality using FastQC, revealing manageable overall quality, though slight trimming was required due to minor quality issues identified.
- Trimmed adapter sequences and low-quality reads using Trim Galore, resulting in improved overall read quality.

- Initially downloaded the Drosophila melanogaster reference genome (dm6 version) and constructed the Bowtie2 index for aligning sequencing reads.
- Attempted alignments of trimmed FASTQ files to the Drosophila reference genome resulted in unexpectedly low alignment rates (approximately 1-4% across all samples).
- Suspecting an issue with the genome version, a different Drosophila reference genome from Ensembl.org was obtained and indexed, but the alignment performance did not improve significantly.

- Due to persistently poor alignments, decided to investigate the source of sequences by extracting a smaller subset (100-500 reads) from sample FASTQ files and converting them to FASTA format.
- Initial BLAST queries through the NCBI website indicated reads predominantly matched human sequences, along with other organisms such as mouse and fungi, with no significant matches to Drosophila melanogaster.
- Conducted a more comprehensive BLAST analysis locally, building separate BLAST databases for the human and Drosophila genomes.
- BLAST analyses against the human genome consistently showed significantly higher alignment rates (ranging from 2.8% to 70.3%), with millions of hits and high identity percentages averaging around 90%.
- In contrast, BLAST queries against the Drosophila database yielded very low alignment rates (ranging from 0.0% to 0.7%), with minimal numbers of hits.

Summary Interpretation:
The data strongly indicates contamination of the Drosophila sequencing samples with human genomic material, explaining the initially poor alignment rates to the Drosophila reference genome. High human alignment percentages, with substantial average identity scores (~89%-98%) and lower mismatch rates, confirm human DNA as the predominant component in the sequencing data. 

07/05/25:
- Validating the experiment was not run on the human (mostly) samples
- Need to assess the level of acetylation across the samples
- Using the bam files that were generated during the initial analysis 
- removing the duplicates from the files using markdup in Samtools
- "samtools_pcr_duplicate_removal_loop.sh" is the hpc script which loops over the bam fiels and performs the removal

08/05/25:
- Ran the script 
- Debugged the script (mainly conda env issues)
- Got the resulting de-duplicated files but issue with the looping
- modified script to only loop over the original JAN-00?.bam files
- the dedup script removed most of the reads 
- reran with proper fixmate args and get better results
