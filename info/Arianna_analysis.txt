
The analysis that she wants ot run involves cut&run extracts taht were perfomred on H3K9 acetylation marks on drosophila larvea disks. The experiment involved the induction of damage to this locus in 6 larvea at 3 dosages per condition (1:100, 1:500 and 1:1000) with a control group without damage. She has provided the coordinates of the integration site and would like to assess whether there is increased presence of the marks in the damaged samples at the site compared to the control. It would also be beneficial to know the border/limits of the increased marks if they in fact do appear there.
