Acetylation Damage Sequencing Analysis

## Section 1: Resource Preparation
- **Reference Genome Acquisition**
  - Downloaded Drosophila melanogaster genome (version BDGP6) and human genome (version GRCh38) from Ensembl.

- **Reference Genome Indexing**
  - Built Bowtie2 indexes for both Drosophila (BDGP6) and human (GRCh38) genomes using `bowtie2-build`.
  - Created BLAST nucleotide databases from both genomes using `makeblastdb`.

## Section 2: Quality Control and Preprocessing
- **FASTQ Quality Check**
  - Used FastQC to assess the quality of raw sequencing reads.
  - Identified minor adapter contamination and quality issues.

- **Adapter Trimming and Quality Filtering**
  - Trimmed adapters and filtered low-quality reads with Trim Galore.
  - Generated trimmed FASTQ files for subsequent analyses.

## Section 3: Preliminary Alignment
- **Bowtie2 Alignment to Drosophila Genome**
  - Attempted initial alignment of trimmed reads to the Drosophila genome using Bowtie2.
  - Observed extremely low alignment rates (<1.3%).

- **Bowtie2 Alignment to Alternative Drosophila Genome**
  - Repeated alignment with an alternative Drosophila genome (Ensembl).
  - Low alignment rates persisted, indicating an underlying issue beyond genome version.

## Section 4: Diagnostic BLAST Analysis
- **Subset FASTA Generation**
  - Sampled subsets (100-1000 reads) from FASTQ files using `seqtk`.
  - Converted sampled subsets into FASTA format for BLAST querying.

- **BLAST Queries against Human and Drosophila Genomes**
  - Queried subset FASTA files against human and Drosophila BLAST databases.
  - Evaluated alignment rates, total hits, average % identity, and mismatches.
  - Identified substantial alignment to the human genome (2.8%-70.3%) and negligible alignment to Drosophila (<1%).

## Section 5: Comprehensive Alignment to Confirm Findings
- **Bowtie2 Alignment to Human Genome**
  - Conducted full-read alignment of all trimmed FASTQ files to the human genome using Bowtie2.
  - High alignment rates observed (up to ~63.86%), with substantial numbers of properly paired reads.

- **Bowtie2 Alignment to Drosophila Genome**
  - Performed final verification alignment to Drosophila genome for comparison.
  - Confirmed extremely low alignment rates (<1.27%) with minimal properly paired reads.

## Section 6: Summarizing and Visualization of Results
- **Alignment Metrics Compilation**
  - Collected and summarized metrics: QC-passed reads, percentage of reads mapped (Bowtie2), BLAST alignment rates, total hits, and average % identity.
  - Visualized metrics using comparative graphs to illustrate discrepancies clearly between human and Drosophila alignments.

## Section 7: Interpretation of Results
- **Identification of Contamination Issue**
  - Interpreted the results clearly indicating significant human DNA contamination or potential mislabeling of samples.
  - Considered potential reasons: sample contamination, sample mislabeling, sequencing facility handling issues, or reagent contamination.
