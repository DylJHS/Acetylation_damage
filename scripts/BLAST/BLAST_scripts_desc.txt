NAME: gen_fasta_subsets_arr.sh

Script Description:
This script automates the creation of random FASTA subsets from paired-end 
sequencing data across multiple experimental sample folders. 
It scans through directories matching the pattern SCC-bulkChIC-UMC-JAN-* 
within a specified data directory, and for each .fastq.gz file corresponding 
to Read 1 or Read 2 of Lane 1 and 2, it extracts a random sample of "SAMPLE_SIZE" 
reads using seqtk. 
These reads are then immediately converted to FASTA format and saved into a 
centralized output directory.

Called in the first part of the full blast workflow (run_blast_wkflw.sh)


NAME: BLASTn_arr.sh

Script Description:
This SLURM submission script performs high-throughput nucleotide BLAST (BLASTn) 
searches on a collection of sampled FASTA reads. It processes each subset 
file generated from experimental sequencing data by comparing it against 
nucleotide reference genomes for human (GRCh38) and Drosophila melanogaster (BDGP6.46).

For each reference genome, it first checks whether a BLAST database exists 
and creates one if missing. It then iterates through each subset FASTA file 
and performs a BLASTn alignment against both species databases, saving the 
results to a designated output directory.

This script is called in the second part of the full blast workflow (run_blast_wkflw.sh)


NAME: gen_blast_summary.sh

Script Description: 
This SLURM submission script summarises the results of the BLASTn query. Separately, 
for both the human queried results and the drosophila results, the script calls its Python
script which calculates statistics across all fasta BLASTn results. The output is 
saved to the BLAST results folder. 

This scirpt is called in the final part of the full blast workflow (run_blast_wkflw.sh)


NAME: summarise_blast_output.py

Script Description:
This Python script processes the output files generated by BLASTn queries and runs with the gen_blast_summary.sh script.
It reads the BLAST results, extracts relevant statistics such as the number of hits,
the average alignment length, and the percentage identity for each sample.
The script then generates a summary report that includes these statistics.
